= Who am I?

Passionate about science, math, arts, music, theater and literature. I'm moved by change and I change as I move. 
To settle in the midst of change is the great art of life.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Physics at Instituto de Física da Universidade de São Paulo (IFUSP). 
I've been a teaching assistant in Calculus 1 and Linear Algebra 1 for the Mathematics Bachelor's students. 
Currently, I translate and record voice-overs from English to Brazilian Portuguese for 3blue1brown, making advanced mathematical 
concepts more accessible to a wider audience.
